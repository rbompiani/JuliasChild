# Project2
Our MVP

What is the app about? :
Virtual recipe box & grocery list generator
“This app’s purpose is to help the at-home chef with their meal planning.”

How will it work?
Page 1: login (username and password)/ sign up/in
Page 2: “use what I have”  OR “try something new” OR “add a recipe to my recipe box”
Page 3: entering ingredients OR  browsing other recipes OR add a recipe to a cute little box
How can it engage and be useful to end users?
This is for the person who cooks often using new recipes or already known recipes. Its also for the at home chef who is short on time and wants to make the best use of ingredients they have on hand.
What is the problem they are facing?
-They need a space to store recipes, grab new ones and save them, or find recipes based on ingredients only. Doing this without an app means the user has to write lists on paper, store them somewhere, create another list for groceries, create a list of what they already have, etc etc.
